# About me
My name is Beni, I graduated at Codecool in 2022 as a Junior Frontend Developer. Before that, I have learned Frontend Development by myself beside my university studies, where I graduated as a Sociologist specialized in Data-driven Social Science.

Developing modern and responsive web applications and websites is my passion, because I like if my work is "tangible" and helps other people. My philosophy is life-long learning, so I'm always open to learn new skills and to broaden my knowledge. I'd love to help create beautiful web applications and websites that make people's everyday lives easier.

There's much more to learn for me, but I'm looking forward to all of it. If I caught your attention, please contact me.
